## Low Priority
- [ ] Expand platform integration tests (requires physical camera, gated behind `device-test` feature). Port in `tests/device_tests.rs` covers query, multi-frame streaming, control enumeration, and `CameraRunner` smoke.
  - Linux is now auto-covered on every PR via `v4l2loopback` (see `.github/workflows/v4l-loopback.yml`) — the V4L `nokhwa::open` dispatch regression is CI-guarded.
  - [x] Camera control round-trip on real hardware (set → get value verification). `tests/device_tests.rs::control_set_get_round_trip` picks the first Manual-mode `IntegerRange` control with headroom, writes a stepped value, re-reads, and asserts. Verified on a Windows MSMF webcam (2026-04-20) against `Brightness` 128 → 129. Skips gracefully on devices that only expose Automatic/ReadOnly controls (e.g. `v4l2loopback`).
  - [ ] macOS / Windows virtual-camera story for GitHub-hosted runners (no clean equivalent of `v4l2loopback`). Currently only the self-hosted `macos-camera` runner covers AVFoundation; MSMF has no CI coverage. (MSMF manually verified on a Windows dev box 2026-04-20: `cargo test --features "input-msmf,device-test,runner" --test device_tests` — 4/4 pass.)

## Performance
(None)

## Backlog
- [ ] Re-implement GStreamer backend (cross-platform, previously 839 lines)
- [ ] Re-implement UVC backend (cross-platform via libusb, previously 561 lines)
- [ ] Re-implement Network/IP camera backend (previously 173 lines)
- [ ] Re-implement WASM/browser backend — requires resolving `wasm-bindgen` non-C enum limitation. Consider `tsify` or `serde-wasm-bindgen`.
